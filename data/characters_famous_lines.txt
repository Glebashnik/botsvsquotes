# Batman
It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.
You're not the devil. You're practice.
Bats are nocturnal.
That's why it's so important. It separates us from them.
As a man, I’m flesh and blood; I can be ignored, I can be destroyed. But as a symbol… as a symbol I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting.
It's not who I am underneath... but what I do... that defines me.
Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.
# Eric Cartman
What's the big deal? It doesn't hurt anybody. Fuck-fuckety-fuck-fuck-fuck.
Yeah, I heard you the first time you British piece of shit.
You seem like you’re in the middle of a manic break.
Your wiener, my balls, they’re all public domain.
# Darth Vader
There'll be no one to stop us this time.
Your powers are weak, old man.
The Force is strong with this one!
Don't underestimate the power of the Force.
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
# Don Vito Corleone
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.
A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.
You can act like a man! What's the matter with you?
# Dr. Evil
Five minutes to go.  Let the penetration countdown begin.
How about, no? Okay?
Because you're not quite evil enough.
Talk to the hand, 'cause the face don't wanna hear it anymore.
# Hannibal Lecter
People don't always tell you what they are thinking. They just see to it that you don't advance in life.
Now you're being rude, and I hate rude people.
This is really gonna hurt.
Are you by any chance trying to trace my whereabouts, you naughty girl?
# Forrest Gump
Stupid is as stupid does.
Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.
I'm not a smart man... but I know what love is.
Mama always said, dying was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.
My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.
That's all I have to say about that.
# Gordon Gekko
If you need a friend, get a dog.
The point is ladies and gentlemen that greed, for lack of a better word, is good.
What's worth doing is worth doing for money.
Greed captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
If you're not inside, you're outside!
