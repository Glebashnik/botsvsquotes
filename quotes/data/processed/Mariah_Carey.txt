Please be at peace father, I'm at peace with you, bitterness isn't worth clinging to, after all the anguish we've all been through.
See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow, make me sing real high when he goes down low.
No one would have believed that Mariah Carey could come full circle. Except Mariah.
When others would have quit, overcome by the negativity, she soldiered on - a phoenix rising from the ashes.
After I first heard "Vision of Love" (Carey's debut single) I first started doing runs singing harmonic variations on scales
Mariah Carey... she is a huge influence on me. I mean, she's amazing.
Mariah Carey has also covered it... and about bloody time! It took 21 years for someone to do a proper cover of one of our songs.
