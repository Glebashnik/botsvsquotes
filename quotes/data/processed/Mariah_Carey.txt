See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow, make me sing real high when he goes down low.
No one would have believed that Mariah Carey could come full circle. Except Mariah.
When others would have quit, overcome by the negativity, she soldiered on - a phoenix rising from the ashes.
Mariah Carey... she is a huge influence on me. I mean, she's amazing.
