One thing is certain in business. You and everyone around you will make mistakes.
My philosophy is that if I have any money I invest it in new ventures and not have it sitting around.
Making money never was my incentive. I just want to fight big companies.
If you want to be a Millionaire, start with a billion dollars and launch a new airline.
I was born under a lucky star, and I have nothing whatsoever to regret. I wouldnâ€™t change a thing about my life.
