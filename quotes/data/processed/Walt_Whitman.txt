I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love.
I say the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be their religion.
I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion’s sake.
None has begun to think how divine he himself is and how certain the future is.
Nothing can happen more beautiful than death.
I have no mockings or arguments; I witness and wait.
In the faces of men and women I see God.
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.
Each of us inevitable; Each of us limitless—each of us with his or her right upon the earth.
The great city is that which has the greatest man or woman.
All, all for immortality, Love like the light silently wrapping all.
Thunder on! Stride on! Democracy. Strike with vengeful stroke!
Over all the sky—the sky! far, far out of reach, studded with the eternal stars.
Give me the splendid silent sun, with all his beams full-dazzling!
Liberty is to be subserved, whatever occurs.
What do you suppose will satisfy the soul except to walk free and own no superior?
To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle, Every cubic inch of space is a miracle.
I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.
I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!
The paths to the house I seek to make, But leave to those to come the house itself.
Society waits unformed and is between things ended and things begun.
One Whitman is miracle enough, and when he comes again it will be the end of the world.
I make a pact with you, Walt Whitman — I have detested you long enough.
