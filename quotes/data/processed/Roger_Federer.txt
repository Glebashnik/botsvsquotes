All four of those are on grass, whereas I have to play some on a hard court!
It's just unreal, I'm shocked myself. I've played good matches here, but never really almost destroyed somebody.
It was just one of those days for him to forget and me to remember.
We are witnessing history. This is the most dominant athlete on planet earth today.
Federer is the best player in history, no other player has ever had such quality.
I really consider myself top 5 player in the world, which doesn't mean that I am close to Roger.
He is on his way to becoming possibly the greatest of all time. But he's still human.
He put tennis, the bar very high&mdash;very high. It's incredible what kind of game he can play.
I'd like to be in his shoes for one day to know what it feels like to play that way.
I'm not sure if he has any weakness in his repertoire.
Maybe Roger Federer will rescue tennis. He plays like we did in the past.
He is capable of hitting shots which other players don't even think about trying. He has so many skills.
Roger is like a good red wine, he's getting better with age...I think his big years will be when he is 26, 27, 28.
Roger hasn't even started to use a lot of his game.
I can cry like Roger, it's just a shame I can't play like him.
