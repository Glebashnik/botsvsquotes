Flash, I love you! But we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!
Keeping our word is one of the things that make us better than you.human
I'd much rather see you on my side, than scattered into... atoms.
Are your men on the right pills? Maybe you should execute their trainer! ''to Klytus, as Flash successfully battles palace guards''
''from the trailer'' Pathetic earthlings... who can save you now?
Open fire! All weapons, now! Charge the lightning field! I take personal responsability sic in the Emperor's name!
We're going to empty your memory as we might empty your pockets... Doctor.
Confess!... and we won't hurt you. We don't like doing this at all!
We do not lead traitors to the Imperial presence.
''to Flash'' Where you go, I follow. ''then to all '' Listen to me! Listen! There is something finer in this galaxy than Ming's law!
''brandishing a laser rifle at some technicians'' FREEZE you bloody bastards! Deactivate the lightning field!
You know Ming's law, Barin. Outside his own kingdom, the hunter becomes the hunted.
Gordon's alive?! ''on learning that Flash survived the Imperial assault''
That must be one hell of a planet you men come from!
