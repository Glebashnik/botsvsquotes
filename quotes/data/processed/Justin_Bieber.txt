I want my world to be fun. No parents, no rules, no nothing. Like, no one can stop me. No one can stop me.
Anything above 40 is a little too old for me. I just look for a girl who is funny and has nice eyes and a smile.
I don't really have an allowance. When I want to get something I just have to ask my mom.
I usually have to be home by 10 o'clock and my mom takes my computer away at 10.30pm every night.
The girls show up wearing nothing. I can’t lie, I’m 16, I don’t hate it. I don’t have a girlfriend.
My mom is my biggest fan. She’s been a fan since I was a baby.
I mean, girlfriends are trouble at this age.
If I can do just one-tenth of the good Michael Jackson did for others, I can really make a difference in this world.
''there is time to play...and then there are times to work hard and get my fans an album.''
I feel like I carry myself in a more manly way. I don’t carry myself as a boy.
''i see all of u. i hear all of u. i never want to let any of you down. i love u. and..thank u.''
After the new album, I'm actually retiring man. I'm retiring.
I want to grow as an artist and I'm taking a step out, I want my music to mature.
My beloved beliebers I'm officially retiring
I was discovered on YouTube and I think I was detrimental to my own career.
He's a great guy. He's doing great out there right now.
