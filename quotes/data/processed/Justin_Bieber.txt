I want my world to be fun. No parents, no rules, no nothing. Like, no one can stop me. No one can stop me.
Anything above 40 is a little too old for me. I just look for a girl who is funny and has nice eyes and a smile.
I try to read all of my fan mail. A lot of them send me candy, which I'm not allowed to eat 'cause my mom says it might be poisonous.
I don't really have an allowance. When I want to get something I just have to ask my mom.
I usually have to be home by 10 o'clock and my mom takes my computer away at 10.30pm every night.
Without the Internet I would have no fans and I wouldn’t be in this business. I owe everything to the Internet and my fans.
The girls show up wearing nothing. I can’t lie, I’m 16, I don’t hate it. I don’t have a girlfriend.
My mom is my biggest fan. She’s been a fan since I was a baby.
I mean, girlfriends are trouble at this age.
If I can do just one-tenth of the good Michael Jackson did for others, I can really make a difference in this world.
I don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them... I think you should just wait for the person you're...in love with.
''there is time to play...and then there are times to work hard and get my fans an album.''
I feel like I carry myself in a more manly way. I don’t carry myself as a boy.
''i see all of u. i hear all of u. i never want to let any of you down. i love u. and..thank u.''
I also heard he got busted for smoking weed and he’s really sorry about it and people make mistakes and he’s never gonna do it again.
After the new album, I'm actually retiring man. I'm retiring.
I want to grow as an artist and I'm taking a step out, I want my music to mature.
My beloved beliebers I'm officially retiring
I was discovered on YouTube and I think I was detrimental to my own career.
He's a great guy. He's doing great out there right now.
