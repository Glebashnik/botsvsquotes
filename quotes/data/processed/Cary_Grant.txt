I suppose you might call me the sophisticated type. I like to act with dialogue. Not with grunts.
I really am a happy, amusing fellow at heart. Trouble is I seem the only one left.
Everyone wants to be Cary Grant. Even I want to be Cary Grant.
I pretended to be somebody I wanted to be until finally I became that person. Or he became me.
My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between, I occupy myself as best I can.
I’m prepared. I have a gun and I know how to shoot, and whoever comes calling without an invitation will get it in the rear end.
When I’m married I want to be single, and when I’m single I want to be married.
