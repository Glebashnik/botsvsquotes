My fatherland has always the first claim on me.
I care very little for Salzburg and not at all for the archbishop: I shit on both of them.
I pay no attention whatever to anybody's praise or blame. I simply follow my own feelings.
I have always reckoned myself among the greatest admirers of Mozart, and shall do so till the day of my death.
Lengthy immersion in the works of other composers can tire. The music of Mozart does not tire, and this is one of its miracles.
Listening to Mozart, we cannot think of any possible improvement.
