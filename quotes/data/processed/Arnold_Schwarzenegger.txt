Just remember, you can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets.
I play the Terminator, but you guys are the true terminators.
Why not? With my way of thinking, you always shoot for the top.
When I was on my way to the podium a gentleman stopped me and said I was as good a politician as I was an actor. What a cheap shot.
I don't worry about it, because I never took an overdosage. (1987)
