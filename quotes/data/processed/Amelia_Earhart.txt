Ours is the commencement of a flying age, and I am happy to have popped into existence at a period so interesting.
Never interrupt someone doing something you said couldn't be done.
Anticipation, I suppose, sometimes exceeds realization.
Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture.
Never do things others can do and will do, if there are things others cannot do or will not do.
Better do a good deed near at home than go far away to burn incense.
