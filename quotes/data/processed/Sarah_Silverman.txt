I'm so glad Courtney Love is here; I left my crack in my other purse.
I didn't lose my virginity until I was twenty-six. Nineteen vaginally, but twenty-six what my boyfriend calls "the real way".
This song brings me back … I was brutally raped to this song.
I don't believe in game of telephone. If he existed, Jesus would fuckin' kill himself.
A couple nights ago, I was licking jelly off my boyfriend's penis. And I thought, "Oh my God — I'm turning into my mother!"
I don't care if you think I'm racist. I just want you to think I'm thin.
I saw my father's penis once. But it was okay, because I was soooo young … and sooo drunk.
I want to get an abortion. But my boyfriend and I are having trouble conceiving.
I've sued my manager for sexual harassment. And it's real hard, and a big strain on me. Because he hasn't done anything.
I was raped by a doctor … which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl.
The writers of "Sanford and Son" were so brave in bringing their program to television. I mean, working with all those black people!

I'll be back. I'll be black. I'll be white black.
