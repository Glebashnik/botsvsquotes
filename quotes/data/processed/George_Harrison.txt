Rap music is just computerised crap. I listen to ''Top of the Pops'' and after three songs I feel like killing someone.
I felt in love, not with anything or anybody in particular but with everything.
That's what the whole Sixties Flower-Power thing was about: "Go away, you bunch of boring people."
If you're listening to this song  You may think the chords are going wrong  But they're not  We just wrote it like that
Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to. Think for yourself 'Cause I won't be there with you.
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping  While my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love  I don't know how someone controlled you  They bought and sold you.
I don't know how you were diverted  You were perverted too.  I don't know how you were inverted  No one alerted you.
Little darling, It's been a long cold lonely winter. Little darling, It feels like years since it's been here. Here comes the sun...
Little darling I feel that ice is slowly melting Little darling It seems like years since it's been clear  Here comes the sun...
