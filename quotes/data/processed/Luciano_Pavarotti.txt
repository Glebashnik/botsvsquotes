''Penso che una vita per la musica sia una vita spesa bene ed Ã¨ a questo che mi sono dedicato.''
I am a very simple person. In spite of all that has happened to me, I have tried to remain the simple person I started out.
Nothing that has happened has made me feel gloomy or remain depressed. I love my life.
