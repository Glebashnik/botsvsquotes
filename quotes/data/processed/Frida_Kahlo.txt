I drank because I wanted to drown my sorrows, but now the damned things have learned to swim.
I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best.
I have suffered two grave accidents in my life, one in which a streetcar knocked me down... The other accident is Diego.
They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality.
I am not sick. I am broken. But I am happy to be alive as long as I can paint.
''Pies, para qu√© los quiero Si tengo alas para volar.''
I hope the exit is joyful and I hope never to return.
The art of Frida Kahlo is a ribbon around a bomb.
If I were a painter, I'd be Frida Kahlo.
