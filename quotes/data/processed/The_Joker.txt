"Life's a bowl of cherries and this is the pits"
"April sweet is coming in, let the feast of fools begin!"
"Stand back, fool, he-he-he, I've got a bomb! Oh, right."
"Over?! Why, my dear, delusional Dark Knight, it hasn't even begun!"
"Paging Doctor Bat, paging Doctor Bat! Is there a Doctor Bat in the room?"
"Welcome to the madhouse, Batman! I set a trap and you sprang it ''gloriously!'' Now let's get this party started."
''While talking to Harley Quinn'' "Oh, you little minx, I could never stay mad at you."
"What's up, doc? Need to take my temperature? I'd be ''happy'' to drop my pants."
"Ladies and murderers! Welcome to the big fight. Batman, you're going down!"
"Ooh. Whatcha sneaking with you, Bats? Oh come on, tell me, tell me. Batarangs? Batclaws? Ooh! Batsnacks?"
''After first encountering Killer Croc'' "That reminds me, I ''really'' need to get me some new shoes."
''Seeing Killer Croc come up the elevator'' "Croc, old boy! Is that you?"
"I can take it. I can take anything you throw at me, Bats."
"C'mon, Bats, get crazy. It's the only way to beat me!"
"Five... Four... Three... Two... One... BOOM! Just kidding!" ''Begins laughing hysterically''
"Ohh, isn't that cute? Little Bats asleepin'! ''(aside)'' Someone finish him off."
''about to shoot Batman in Scarecrow's final mind game'' "Let's get this party started - with a bang!"
"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat. Watch me kill your favorite cat."
''as Clayface-Joker'' "You fell for the old fake Joker gag, Batman! You left me to die! {starts laughing}"
"Is someone feeling a little down? Well, cheer up, Bats; it won't kill ya.... Oops!"
"It's ok to die, Bats, I'll be here to protect Gotham! I'll do a real good job."
''as Clayface-Joker'' "Oh, come on! There's always something to learn. Let's start with 'Getting Your Ass Kicked 101.'"
"Get out of the way, Bats! I've got a date with immortality!"
"Think of it as a running gag!" ''Stabs Batman in the back, dropping the cure and the Joker's only chance of survival''
"Hurry! Batman's just had his way with one of you! ''Now that's a spicy meat-a-ball!''"
"Well, sounds like I can cross 'hear a grown man cry' off my Christmas list. Thanks, fellas!"
"You're saying that after I ''shot him'', and ''blew up'' a building on him, ''the Bat - somehow survived?!!?''"
''to Black Mask'' "''Can't... you... just... play... along?!''"
"Looks like I'm gonna need to find a new playmate. Oh, and we were having so much fun, too!"
"Aww, gotta say, I thought you'd have more fight in you! A LOT more fight!"
"Ding dong! The bat is dead! Which old bat? The dumb old bat! Ding dong, the dumb old bat is dead!"
"I present to you: the death of the Batman!"
"Mmm! This fruitcake is fantastic! (''pause, stabs the knife on the table'') Anyone want a piece?"
''sees that Gordon has taken the bullet for Warden Joseph'' "Well, ''that's'' the Christmas spirit!"
''to Batman'' "Fresh off a kill and back for more, eh?"
"Come on, baby! Beat me 'til your knuckles bleed... And why quit there? You know there's only one way to stop me."
(to Superman) "More powerful than a locomotive, and just about as subtle."
"You dirty rat! You killed my brother! My sister! My daughter! She's my sister ''and'' my daughter!"
"Lady, you're harder to kill than a cockroach on steroids"
(to Batman) "Quick question. When the clock strikes twelve, do I get a little kiss?"
"Oh, Batman, if you had the guts for that kind of fun you would've done it years ago. I, on the other hand..."
"If I weren't insane: I couldn't be so brilliant!"
"Reclaimed from the dead! All crimes paid for! The slate wiped clean! The Joker is free! Ha! Ha!"
"Oh, well...I suppose the Joker's holiday had to end some time!"
"I did it! I finally killed Batman! In front of a bunch of vulnerable, disabled kids!!! Now get me Santa Claus!"
"If the police expect to play against the Joker, they'd better be prepared to be dealt from the bottom of the deck!"
"It's a clear choice -- me or Pettit. Vote or die. Cancer or tuberculosis."
"Every clown loves kids, captain. Just ask Sarah-Essen-Gordon. Oh, that's right, you can't!"
(As Nightwing pummels him) "Aw... Jeez... I hit Jason a lot harder than that. (Pause) His name was Jason, right?"
