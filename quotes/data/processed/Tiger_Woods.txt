I love to compete. That's the essence of who I am.
My goal is to remain healthy my entire career, and a healthy diet seems like a good start.
We have a lot of fun every year, and I really enjoy being part of junior golf and the development of these players.
I don't want to be the best black golfer, I want to be the best golfer, period.
