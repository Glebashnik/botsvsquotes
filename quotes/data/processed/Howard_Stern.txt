Courage is standing up for what you believe in. There are so many people who aren't willing to stand up. You've got to fight.
I still feel like I gotta prove something. â€¦ There are a lot of people hoping I fail. But I like that. I need to be hated.
I think it's my identity. Like, this is who I am. This is what I do.... Like I'm Babe Ruth, you know?
