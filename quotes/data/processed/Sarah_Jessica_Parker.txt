I've always been an actor. That's my job — I can be anything you want me to be.
I didn't think I was going to be a person who other people knew, whose name was recognizable.
Just because people don't have money doesn't mean they don't desire the same thing. They should have it, and it should be good.
I strangely feel better before I go through hair and makeup. Maybe that's just because I feel like me.
That's the beauty of this country — we can have different opinions and coexist and be amused by each other and hurt and offended.
