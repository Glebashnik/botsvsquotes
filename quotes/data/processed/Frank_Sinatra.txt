What I do with my life is of my own doing. I live it the best way I can.
Whatever else has been said about me personally is unimportant. When I sing, I believe. I'm honest.
If you possess something but you can't give it away, then you don't possess it... it possesses you.
The big lesson in life, baby, is never be scared of anyone or anything.
I think Frank Sinatra was the most hated man of World War II, much more than Hitler.
It's Frank's world, we're all just livin' in it.
