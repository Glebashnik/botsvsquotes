You better watch out  You better not cry  Better not pout  I'm telling you why â€”  Santa Claus is coming to town!
They err who think Santa Claus enters through the chimney. He enters through the heart.
I stopped believing in Santa Claus when I was six. Mother took me to see him in a department store and he asked for my autograph.
