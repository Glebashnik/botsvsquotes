People like me are what stand between us and Auschwitz. I see evil around me every day.
I'm not a natural leader. I'm too intellectual; I'm too abstract; I think too much.
I'm not studying this, I'm not looking at it in great detail, but the last guy to announce on your show came in fourth.
I'm opposed to giving people money for doing nothing.
I believe the kids could mop the floor and clean up the bathroom and get paid for it and it would be OK.
