There are certain guys that are band players and there's certain guys that ain't. If there's anybody lazier than me, it's Eric (Clapton).
I looked upon myself, in a sort of romantic and silly way, as like a laboratory.
I was number one on the Who's Likely To Die list for 10 years. I mean, I was really disappointed when I fell off the list.
The idea of retiring is like killing yourself. It's almost like Hari Kari. I intend to live to a 100 and go down in history.
I don't encourage anybody to do what I do, you know? Why should you? More for me!
