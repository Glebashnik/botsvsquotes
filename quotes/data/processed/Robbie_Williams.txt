The world could change in a second, so I find the sunshine beckons me, to open up the gate and dream.
I look above, and I know I'll always be blessed with love.
Well tonight I'm gonna live for today, so come along for the ride, I hope I'm old before I die.
Hell is gone and heaven's here, there’s nothing left for you to fear.
I sit and talk to God, and he just laughs at my plans.
I'm not scared of dying, I just don't want to. If I stop lying, I'll just disappoint you.
I'm contemplating thinking about thinking… but....it's overrated - just get another drink in!
All your friends think you're satisfied, but they can't see your soul, no, no, no...
Screw you, I didn't like your taste anyway, I chose you, That's all gone to waste, It's Saturday, I'll go out and find another you.
I've sung some songs that were lame, I've slept with girls on the game.
I'm here to make money and get laid, Yeah I'm a star but I'll fade.
I'm glad that spending a night with me, Guaranteed you celebrity.
Oh I haven't got a clue what to do with you, Jesus all the things my head is going through.
