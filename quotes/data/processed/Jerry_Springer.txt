Until next time, take care of yourself and each other.
I'm not conflicted. Because I know. There's me, and there's the show.
I create this persona for the show. And that's what it is. I'm an act.
I should get a weekend show where all I do is play country music.
Showbiz is a job. I never take it too seriously. I work hard, but I never pretend it’s life or death. I’m just incredibly lucky.
