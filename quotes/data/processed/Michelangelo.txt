Beauty is the purgation of superfluities.
I was never the kind of painter or sculptor who kept a shop.
If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all.
If you knew how much work went into it, you would not call it genius.
What do you despise? By this you are truly known.
Enough, enough, enough! Say no more! Lump the whole thing! say the Creator made Italy from designs by Michael Angelo!
