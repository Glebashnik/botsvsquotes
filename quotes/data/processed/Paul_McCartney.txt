She's lovely, great. She was very friendly. She was just like a mum to us.
We probably seem to be anti-religious...none of us believes in God.
We thought we'd be really big in Liverpool.
I'd like to be able to go on holiday and not to have to hold my belly in for two whole weeks.
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away  Now it looks as though they're here to stay.  Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say  I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play  Now I need a place to hide away.  Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Lovely Rita, Meter Maid, nothing could come between us.  When it gets dark I'll tow your heart away
Will you still need me,  will you still feed me, when I'm sixty-four?
Obladi oblada life goes on bra  Lala how the life goes on
And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.
I thought the only lonely place was on the moon.
