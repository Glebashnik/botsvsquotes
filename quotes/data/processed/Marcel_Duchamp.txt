Painting is over and done with. Who could do anything better than this propeller? Look, could you do that?
I have forced myself to contradict myself in order to avoid conforming to my own tastes.
I wanted to kill art for myself.. ..a new thought for that object.
I just like - just breathing. I like breathing better than working.
