Violence is a form of cinematic entertainment.
I look at ''Death Proof'' and realize I had too much time.
I am a genre lover &ndash; everything from spaghetti western to samurai movie.
To me, torture would be watching sports on television.
But can I tell the genuine-article Italian from the poseur Italian? No. To me they all seem like poseurs.
