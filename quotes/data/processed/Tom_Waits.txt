If I exorcise my devils, well, my angels may leave too.
Don't you know there ain't no devil, there's just God when he's drunk.
How do the angels get to sleep / When the Devil leaves his porch light on?
I'm so goddamn horny, the crack of dawn better be careful around me!

What's he building in there? We have a right to know.
Come down off the cross, we can use the wood.
And someone will head south 'til this whole thing cools off.
If you get far enough away you'll be on your way back home.
The large print giveth and the small print taketh away.
Some men are searching for the Holy Grail, but there ain't nothing sweeter than riding the rail.
