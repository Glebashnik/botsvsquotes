(After setting fake bust on fire and putting it out) Look at this! My first day as a woman and I'm getting hot flashes.
I can hip-hop, be-bop, dance till ya drop, and yo yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa.
Ohh thank you, dear. Yes, touch me again and I'll drown you ya bastard!
(Is walking across the street, then almost gets mugged. Hits mugger in the face.) (As Daniel) Back off, asshole! BEAT IT!
Upstairs, my little noseminers! Go! Flee before me! Onward and upward! Go pump some neurons. Expand your craniums!
Ever wish you could freeze frame a moment in your day, and look at it and say "this is not my life"?
(after burning his hands on a hot cooking pot) Mother!!
It's a voiceover. It's an interior monologue. Maybe even the voice of God. That's even better.
She Makes Dinner. She Does Windows. She Reads Bedtime Stories. She's A Blessing... In Disguise.
