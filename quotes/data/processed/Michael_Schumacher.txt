I'm Michael Schumacher. I don't need to test my driving ability
With the car we had, getting a pole was sort of obvious.
Just being a mediocre driver has never been my ambition. That's not my style.
I've always believed that you should never, ever give up and you should always keep fighting even when there's only a slightest chance.
It is a pity for F1 to lose such a great champion, but the time to stop comes to everyone.
