I did not get on the bus to get arrested. I got on the bus to go home.
God has always given me the strength to say what is right... I had the strength of God and my ancestors with me.
From my upbringing and the Bible I learned people should stand up for rights just as the children of Israel stood up to the Pharaoh.
I would like to be known as a person who is concerned about freedom and equality and justice and prosperity for all people.
Since I have always been a strong believer in God, I knew that He was with me, and only He could get me through that next step.
I have learned over the years that when one's mind is made up, this diminishes fear; knowing what must be done does away with fear.
