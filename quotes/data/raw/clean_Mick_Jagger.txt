Childhood living is easy to do <br /> The things you wanted, I bought them for you <br /> Graceless lady, you know who I am <br /> You know I can't let you slide through my hands <br /> Wild horses couldn't drag me away <br /> Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away.
I know I've dreamed you, a sin and a lie <br /> I have my freedom but I don't have much time <br /> Faith has been broken, tears must be cried <br /> Let's do some living, after we die <br /> Wild horses couldn't drag me away <br /> Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some dayâ€¦

We have not had any disagreements about clothes, smoking or L'Wren, and this is all very hurtful for her... It is completely untrue to say that L'Wren has caused a rift between myself and the rest of the band. This is all nonsense, everyone has their own style.
If you think that Mick Jagger will still be doing the whole rock star thing at age fifty, well, then, you are sorely, sorely mistaken.
I thought it was ludicrous to take one of those gongs from the establishment... it's not what the Stones is about, is it? I don't want to step out on stage with someone wearing a fucking coronet and sporting the old ermine. I told Mick, 'It's a fucking paltry honour.'
