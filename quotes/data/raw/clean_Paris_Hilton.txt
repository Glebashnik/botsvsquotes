That's hot!.
I used to act dumb. It was an act. I am 26 years old, and that act is no longer cute. It is not who I am, nor do I want to be that person for the young girls who looked up to me. I know now that I can make a difference, that I have the power to do that. I have been thinking that I want to do different things when I am out of here. I have become much more spiritual. God has given me this new chance.
You're a fucking bitch. I'm going to destroy you.
To me, anything goes. But that's me.
You need to look like a lady at the Oscars. Otherwise, Joan Rivers will tear you apart. Then again, you aren't really anyone till Joan Rivers tears you apart.
The only rule is don't be boring and dress cute wherever you go. Life is too short to blend in.
What's Wal-mart? Do they sell Walls and stuff?
