The really frightening thing about middle age is the knowledge that you'll grow out of it.
I’ve been through everything. I always said I was like those round-bottomed circus dolls — you know, those dolls you could push down and they’d come back up? I’ve always been like that. I’ve always said, "No matter what happens, if I get pushed down, I’m going to come right back up." 
Gratitude is riches. Complaint is poverty.
