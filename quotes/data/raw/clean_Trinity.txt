I could wish that men would consider three things which are within themselves. These three things are quite different from the Trinity, but I mention them in order that men may exercise their minds and test themselves and come to realize how different from it they are. The three things I speak of are: to be, to know, and to will. For I am, and I know, and I will. I am a knowing and a willing being; I know that I am and that I will; and I will to be and to know. In these three functions, therefore, let him who can see how integral a life is; for there is one life, one mind, one essence. Finally, the distinction does not separate the things, and yet it is a distinction.
When I, who conduct this inquiry, love something, then three things are found: I, what I love, and the love itself. â€¦ There are, therefore three things: the lover, the beloved and the love.
The mind itself, its love of itself and it knowledge of itself are a kind of trinity.
