I love to compete. That's the essence of who I am.
I don't see myself as the Great Black Hope. I'm just a golfer who happens to be black and Asian. It doesn't matter whether they're white, black, brown or green.
My goal is to remain healthy my entire career, and a healthy diet seems like a good start.
I think the best thing is being able to play golf competitively for a living. Ever since I was a little boy, that's something I've always wanted to do, and now I get a chance to live out my dreams.
I've done it before. It won't be the last time. You're going to go years where you just don't win. That's okay, as long as you keep trying to improve.
I am pretty health-conscious, so when my girlfriend and/or I make dinner--no, I don't have a cook!--we choose the healthier options: lean meats, steamed veggies, fish, etc. Of course, there are always those cravings for the "bad foods" that I do give in to once in a while!
My body is a little bit sore from all of the practicing and playing and training, and your mind gets a little tired of it, too. It's nice to be able to recharge and come back fresh for the remainder of the year.
We have a lot of fun every year, and I really enjoy being part of junior golf and the development of these players.
I don't want to be the best black golfer, I want to be the best golfer, period.
Buddhism teaches that a craving for things outside ourselves causes an unhappy and pointless search for security. It teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously, I lost track of what I was taught.
Life isn't all Golf.
