Excuse my dust.
And she had It. It, hell; she had Those.
Salary is no object: I want only enough to keep body and soul apart.
Well, Aimee Semple McPherson has written a book. And were you to call it a little peach, you would not be so much as scratching its surface. It is the story of her life, and it is called ''In the Service of the King'', which title is perhaps a bit dangerously suggestive of a romantic novel. It may be that this autobiography is set down in sincerity, frankness and simple effort. It may be, too, that the Statue of Liberty is situated in Lake Ontario.
And it is that word 'hummy,' my darlings, that marks the first place in ''The House at Pooh Corner'' at which Tonstant Weader fwowed up.

It's not the tragedies that kill us; it's the messes.
All those writers who write about their own childhood! Gentle God, if I wrote about mine you wouldn't sit in the same room with me.
On being told of Calvin Coolidge's death How do they know? (Coolidge was well-known for being a man of very few words.)
There is no such hour on the present clock as 6:30, New York time. Yet, as only New Yorkers know, if you can get through the twilight, you'll live through the night.
