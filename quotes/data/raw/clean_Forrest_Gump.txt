My momma always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."
Now, because I had been a football star, and a war hero, and a national celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat captain, and a college graduate, the city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, decided to get together and offered me a fine job. So I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan, though he did take care of my Bubba-Gump money. He got me invested in some kind of fruit company. And so then I got a call from him saying we don't have to worry about money no more. And I said "That's good. One less thing." Now, Momma said there's only so much fortune a man really needs and the rest is just for showing off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it to the Foursquare Gospel Church and I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital. And even though Bubba was dead, and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts, I gave Bubba's momma Bubba's share. And you know what? She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more. And 'cause I was gazillionaire and I liked doing it so much, I cut that grass for free. But at nighttime, when there was nothing to do and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny. And then, she was there.
''both is happening at the same time. I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything you need, I won't be far away.
