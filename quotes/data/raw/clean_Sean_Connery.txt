I suppose more than anything else I'd like to be an old man with a good face, like Hitchcock or Picasso. They know that life is not just a popularity contest.
An open-handed slap is justified &ndash; if all other alternatives fail and there has been plenty of warning. If a woman is a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually, then I'd do it.
There are women who take it to the wire. That's what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack.
