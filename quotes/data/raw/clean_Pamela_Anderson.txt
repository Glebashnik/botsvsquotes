*Sexuality is an expression of our spirituality. Sex makes you get real.
I love doing what I do, but I don't like seeing the finished product.
When I did TV shows and movies, the studios did demographic research. They were shocked to find that my audience isn't just men who are too drunk to turn off the TV after football. It's women, too. I don't know exactly why, other than that I've tried to remain true to myself for all these years. I have gone through a lot, and I've been open about it. Maybe they look at me and can see how you can grow up, have children, continue to be sexy, get married and divorced and, though you grew up poor, live the American dream. I'm very blessed. I'm happy for it all.
I thought of a great way to celebrate my Finnish heritage at home. I'm going to look into opening a chain of strip clubs, and I'll call them Lapland!!!
What's going on outside? It was really nice - all the fans out there with big signs.
*My breasts have had a brilliant career. I've just tagged along for the ride.
