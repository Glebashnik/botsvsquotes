I hope life treats you kind  And I hope you have all you've dreamed of.  And I wish to you, joy and happiness.  But above all this, I wish you love.
If I should stay,  I would only be in your way.  So I'll go, but I know  I'll think of you ev'ry step of the way.<p> And I will always love you.  I will always love you.
Now Momma's done away with the old black kettle she used to cook in when I was just little  And the door ain't sprung on her electric range  That little old farm and home we had it ain't there no more and that's too bad  Folks are doing away with the simple things...
They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see  That one is only poor only if they choose to be  Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be <br?> In my coat of many colors that Momma made for me  Made just for me...
You can have your choice of men but I could never love again  He's the only one for me Jolene  I have to have this talk with you  My happiness depends on you and whatever  You decide to do Jolene...
