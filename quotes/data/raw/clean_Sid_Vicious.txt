I'm not vicious really. I consider myself kind-hearted. I love my mum.
I'll probably die by the time I reach 25. But I'll have lived the way I wanted to.
Well, you know, like, I don't really give a fuck what the general public think.
American audiences are just the same as anybody else. Except a bit more boring.
The band broke up because I couldn't bear Rotten anymore because he was an embarrassment with his silly hats and his, like, shabby, dirty, nasty looking appearance.
You just pick up a chord, go twang, and you've got music.
We had a death pact. I have to keep my half of the bargain. Please bury me next to my baby in my leather jacket, jeans and motor cycle boots. Goodbye.
All I did was cash in on the fact that I'm good-looking and I have a good figure and girls like me.
I'm not chic, I could never be chic. I was in it from its inception.
Everybody wanted to be with Sid, but unfortunately he came with Nancy. She was unbelievably thick-skinned, one of the most unlikable people I've met. Everybody could see through her, except Sid.
As soon as (Sid) realised how much everyone hated Nancy, man, he stuck to her like a stamp to a letter. That´s why he was called "Sid": he hated the name Sid, so everyone called him Sid. That´s what that whole scene was about. But when we got fucked up, he got very violent actually. He was shooting speed before he met Nancy, and when she got him into dope it was a very easy switch to make; then it was all over for him. He`d never been with a woman before, where she had that kind of control over him... Nancy was an opportunist. I'm not even going to say whether I liked her or not, but she had a negative effect on Sid and he didn't need that.
