Flash, I love you! But we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!
Keeping our word is one of the things that make us better than you.human
I'd much rather see you on my side, than scattered into... atoms.
Pathetic earthlings. Hurling your bodies out into the void, without the slightest inkling of who or what is out here. If you had known anything about the true nature of the universe, anything at all, you would've hidden from it in terror.
Are your men on the right pills? Maybe you should execute their trainer! ''to Klytus, as Flash successfully battles palace guards''
''from the trailer'' Pathetic earthlings... who can save you now?
Open fire! All weapons, now! Charge the lightning field! I take personal responsability sic in the Emperor's name!
We're going to empty your memory as we might empty your pockets... Doctor.
Confess!... and we won't hurt you. We don't like doing this at all!
We do not lead traitors to the Imperial presence.
''to Flash'' Welcome back from the grave. ''Princess Aura'' I knew you were up to something, though I'll confess I never thought of necrophilla.
''to Flash'' Where you go, I follow. ''then to all '' Listen to me! Listen! There is something finer in this galaxy than Ming's law!
Tell me more about this man Houdini. ''to Zarkov, while blindfolded and manacled to a dungeon wall''<blockquote></blockquote>
''brandishing a laser rifle at some technicians'' FREEZE you bloody bastards! Deactivate the lightning field!
We owe everything to Flash!
You know Ming's law, Barin. Outside his own kingdom, the hunter becomes the hunted.
Gordon's alive?! ''on learning that Flash survived the Imperial assault''
Flying blind on a rocket cycle?
That must be one hell of a planet you men come from!
Squadron 40! DIVE!
Impetuous boy! Ah, well... who wants to live forever? DIVE! (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krJhxtTI4GU#t=0m48s youtube.com)
