These movies are like my children, except you can't remake my children in 3D to push up the grosses.
I like it when interviews are brief. Are we done yet?
Some people say, "New York's a great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there." I say that about other places.
There's no such thing as not being afraid.
I didn't have a problem with rejection, because when you go into an audition, you're rejected already. There are hundreds of other actors. You're behind the eight ball when you go in there.
The hardest thing about being famous is that people are always nice to you. You're in a conversation and everybody's agreeing with what you're sayingâ€”even if you say something totally crazy. You need people who can tell you what you ''don't'' want to hear.
When I'm directing a great dramatic scene, part of me is saying, "Thank God I don't have to do that." Because I know how fucking hard it is to act. It's the middle of the night. It's freezing. You gotta do this scene. You gotta get it up to get to that point. And yet, as a director, you've got to get the actors to that point. It's hard either way.
As you get older, the more complicated things get. It's almost therapeutic to be doing simple things with the kids.
If you don't go, you'll never know.
