*I am so daunted by reputation that I never think about it. It is a thing bigger than I am capable of perceiving. Other people are more aware and concerned with it than I could ever allow myself to be.
*I don’t know what my image is. I went to France to publicize Marvin’s Room, and one really smart young woman journalist said to me “You know, what I told people I was going to interview Meryl Streep, they were so excited...all ze woman in my office, they love you so much. But ze men - they are afraid of you.
*Hollywood to me is what it is to you. It's something other than what I am. I sit outside it.
*I live simply. I don't buy a lot of fashion!
*Well, aren't we all grateful to be alive? I just know lots of people … at my age, I've lost a lot of people in my life and I'm very grateful to be here. That's what I mean.
*I don't really. In our business, you're not kicked out necessarily …
*No! But they were here in Los Angeles. Here they were surprised, because it was difficult to finance, the film. A lot of the executives would say, 'I just don't get it.'
*Half of me is Streep and the other half is Wilkinson from Lincolnshire so I come by it honestly, this part.
*I am nothing but these people, and as an actor I’m always trying to call up lives and the reason I know these things as an actor is because I have the DNA of all these crazy people.
*I’m so sorry to hear this, but this is what it is. It makes it feels like it’s sort of my fault on some level, but it also connect be to those events, those first encounters between the two cultures must have been raw, terrifying, brutal and final. conflicts in early American history, known as King Philip’s War, or Metacom’s War, Lawrence Wilkinson defended his town in the face of fierce violence from the Native Americans.
*I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I have no patience for cynicism, excessive criticism and demands of any nature. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me. I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. I decided not to coexist anymore with pretense, hypocrisy, dishonesty and cheap praise. I do not tolerate selective erudition nor academic arrogance. I do not adjust either to popular gossiping. I hate conflict and comparisons. I believe in a world of opposites and that’s why I avoid people with rigid and inflexible personalities. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. Exaggerations bore me and I have difficulty accepting those who do not like animals. And on top of everything I have no patience for anyone who does not deserve my patience.
*Meryl Streep could obviously have made it to the screen on looks alone. The fashion-model figure, for that ash-blond hair, oval face, porcelain skin and those high, exquisite cheekbones. Her eyes mirror intelligence; their pale blue sparkle demands a new adjective: 'merulean. Only a slight bump down the plane of her long, patrician nose redeems her profile from perfection.
*And at this stage in her seemingly charmed life, when she's moved to Los Angeles and has three children in three different private schools and is redoing a house on the Westside and worrying about fabric samples, she's careered off the beaten path of high drama, if temporarily, to cultivate her comedic connections.
*Meryl Streep’s image is composed of two distinct image clusters centered on her renown as a great actress and her reputation as a devoted wife and mother. A more muted aspect of her star persona – one that is often masked as merely an offshoot of her maternal devotion –is her social activism.
*Even being in a rehearsal period, with Meryl Streep watching, is a behind-tightening experience.
*Her roots go back to Providence, Rhode Island, as one of the founding fathers of Rhode Island.
Streep, who was born in New Jersey, is known to have historic family ties to Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
