God is sitting here, looking into my very soul to see if I think right thoughts. Yet I am not afraid, for I try to be right and good; and He knows every one of my struggles.
*My friends are my "estate." Forgive me then the avarice to hoard them.
GLEE! the great storm is over!  Four have recovered the land;  Forty gone down together  Into the boiling sand. <p> Ring, for the scant salvation!  Toll, for the bonnie souls,—  Neighbor and friend and bridegroom,  Spinning upon the shoals! <p> How they will tell the shipwreck  When winter shakes the door,  Till the children ask, “But the forty?  Did they come back no more?” <p> Then a silence suffuses the story, And a softness the teller’s eye;  And the children no  further question,  And only the waves reply.
IF I can stop one heart from breaking,  I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching, Or cool one pain,  Or help one fainting robin  Unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain.
MUCH madness is divinest sense  To a discerning eye;  Much sense the starkest madness.  ’T is the majority  In this, as all, prevails. Assent, and you are sane;  Demur,—you ’re straightway dangerous,  And handled with a chain.
I NEVER hear the word “escape”  Without a quicker blood,  A sudden expectation,  A flying attitude. <p> I never hear of prisons broad  By soldiers battered down,  But I tug childish at my bars,—  Only to fail again!
SURGEONS must be very careful When they take the knife! Underneath their fine incisions  Stirs the culprit,—Life!
IT tossed and tossed,—  A little brig I knew,—  O’ertook by blast,  It spun and spun,  And groped delirious, for morn. <p> It slipped and slipped,  As one that drunken stepped;  Its white foot tripped,  Then dropped from sight. <p> Ah, brig, good-night  To crew and you;  The ocean’s heart too smooth, too blue, To break for you.
I TOOK my power in my hand  And went against the world;  ’T was not so much as David had,  But I was twice as bold. <p> I aimed my pebble, but myself  Was all the one that fell.  Was it Goliath was too large,  Or only I too small?
MINE enemy is growing old,—  I have at last revenge.  The palate of the hate departs; If any would avenge,— <p> Let him be quick, the viand flits,  It is a faded meat. Anger as soon as fed is dead;  ’T is starving makes it fat.
IT ’S such a little thing to weep,  So short a thing to sigh;  And yet by trades the size of these  We men and women die!
DROWNING is not so pitiful  As the attempt to rise.  Three times, ’t is said, a sinking man  Comes up to face the skies,  And then declines forever  To that abhorred abode <p> Where hope and he part company,— For he is grasped of God.  The Maker’s cordial visage,  However good to see,  Is shunned, we must admit it,  Like an adversity.
WHO has not found the heaven below  Will fail of it above.  God’s residence is next to mine,  His furniture is love.
UPON the gallows hung a wretch,  Too sullied for the hell To which the law entitled him.  As nature’s curtain fell  The one who bore him tottered in,  For this was woman’s son.  “’T was all I had,” she stricken gasped;  Oh, what a livid boon!
FATE slew him, but he did not drop;  She felled—he did not fall— Impaled him on her fiercest stakes—  He neutralized them all. <p> She stung him, sapped his firm advance,  But, when her worst was done,  And he, unmoved, regarded her,  Acknowledged him a man.
IT might be easier  To fail with land in sight,  Than gain my blue peninsula  To perish of delight.
HOW happy is the little stone That rambles in the road alone,  And does n’t care about careers,  And exigencies never fears;  Whose coat of elemental brown  A passing universe put on; And independent as the sun,  Associates or glows alone,  Fulfilling absolute decree  In casual simplicity.
NEW feet within my garden go, New fingers stir the sod; A troubadour upon the elm Betrays the solitude. <p> New children play upon the green,  New weary sleep below;  And still the pensive spring returns,  And still the punctual snow!
THE PEDIGREE of honey Does not concern the bee;  A clover, any time, to him  Is aristocracy.
THE GRASS so little has to do,—  A sphere of simple green,  With only butterflies to brood,  And bees to entertain, <p> And stir all day to pretty tunes  The breezes fetch along,  And hold the sunshine in its lap  And bow to everything; <p> And thread the dews all night, like pearls,  And make itself so fine,-  A duchess were too common  For such a noticing. <p> And even when it dies, to pass  In odors so divine,  As lowly spices gone to sleep,  Or amulets of pine. <p> And then to dwell in sovereign barns, And dream the days away,— The grass so little has to do,  I wish I were a hay!
PRESENTIMENT is that long shadow on the lawn  Indicative that suns go down;  The notice to the startled grass That darkness is about to pass.
IT makes no difference abroad,  The seasons fit the same, The mornings blossom into noons,  And split their pods of flame. <p> Wild-flowers kindle in the woods,  The brooks brag all the day;  No blackbird bates his jargoning  For passing Calvary. <p> Auto-da-fé and judgment  Are nothing to the bee;  His separation from his rose  To him seems misery.
LOVE is anterior to life,  Posterior to death,  Initial of creation, and  The exponent of breath.
THERE is a word  Which bears a sword  Can pierce an armed man.  It hurls its barbed syllables,—  At once is mute again.  But where it fell  The saved will tell  On patriotic day,  Some epauletted brother  Gave his breath away. <p> Wherever runs the breathless sun,  Wherever roams the day,  There is its noiseless onset,  There is its victory!  Behold the keenest marksman!  The most accomplished shot!  Time’s sublimest target  Is a soul “forgot”!
HEART, we will forget him!  You and I, to-night!  You may forget the warmth he gave,  I will forget the light. <p> When you have done, pray tell me,  That I my thoughts may dim;  Haste! lest while you’re lagging,  I may remember him!
I NEVER saw a moor,  I never saw the sea; Yet know I how the heather looks,  And what a wave must be.  I never spoke with God, Nor visited in heaven;  Yet certain am I of the spot  As if the chart were given.
I REASON, earth is short,  And anguish absolute.  And many hurt;  But what of that? <p> I reason, we could die:  The best vitality  Cannot excel decay;  But what of that? <p> I reason that in heaven  Somehow, it will be even,  Some new equation given;  But what of that?
NO rack can torture me,  My soul ’s at liberty.  Behind this mortal bone  There knits a bolder one <p> You cannot prick with saw,  Nor rend with scymitar.  Two bodies therefore be;  Bind one, and one will flee. <p> The eagle of his nest  No easier divest  And gain the sky,  Than mayest thou, <p> Except thyself may be  Thine enemy;  Captivity is consciousness,  So’s liberty.
A DEATH-BLOW is a life-blow to some  Who, till they died, did not alive become;  Who, had they lived, had died, but when  They died, vitality begun.
OUR journey had advanced;  Our feet were almost come  To that odd fork in Being’s road,  Eternity by term. <p> Our pace took sudden awe,  Our feet reluctant led.  Before were cities, but between,  The forest of the dead. <p> Retreat was out of hope,—  Behind, a sealed route,  Eternity’s white flag before,  And God at every gate.
THAT such have died enables us  The tranquiller to die;  That such have lived, certificate  For immortality.
THE DISTANCE that the dead have gone  Does not at first appear;  Their coming back seems possible  For many an ardent year. <p> And then, that we have followed them  We more than half suspect,  So intimate have we become  With their dear retrospect.
BLESS God, he went as soldiers,  His musket on his breast;  Grant, God, he charge the bravest  Of all the martial blest. <p> Please God, might I behold him  In epauletted white,  I should not fear the foe then,  I should not fear the fight.
IMMORTAL is an ample word  When what we need is by,  But when it leaves us for a time,  ’T is a necessity. <p> Of heaven above the firmest proof  We fundamental know,  Except for its marauding hand,  It had been heaven below.
SO proud she was to die  It made us all ashamed  That what we cherished, so unknown  To her desire seemed. <p> So satisfied to go  Where none of us should be,  Immediately, that anguish stooped  Almost to jealousy.
FAME is a fickle food Upon a shifting plate,  Whose table once a Guest, but not  The second time, is set.  Whose crumbs the crows inspect,  And with ironic caw  Flap past it to the Farmer’s corn;  Men eat of it and die.
THE BLUNDER is to estimate,—  “Eternity is Then,”  We say, as of a station.  Meanwhile he is so near,  He joins me in my ramble,  Divides abode with me,  No friend have I that so persists  As this Eternity.
THERE is a solitude of space, A solitude of sea, A solitude of death, but these  Society shall be,  Compared with that profounder site,  That polar privacy,  A Soul admitted to Itself:  Finite Infinity.
NATURE is what we see,  The Hill, the Afternoon— Squirrel, Eclipse, the Bumble-bee, Nay—Nature is Heaven. <p> Nature is what we hear, The Bobolink, the Sea—  Thunder, the Cricket— Nay,—Nature is Harmony. <p> Nature is what we know  But have no art to say,  So impotent our wisdom is  To Her simplicity.
SOME Days retired from the rest  In soft distinction lie, The Day that a companion came—  Or was obliged to die.
THE SWEETS of Pillage can be known  To no one but the Thief,  Compassion for Integrity  Is his divinest Grief.
THE FACE we choose to miss,  Be it but for a day— As absent as a hundred years  When it has rode away.
Success is counted sweetest  By those who ne'er succeed.  To comprehend a nectar  Requires a sorest need.<p> Not one of all the purple Host  Who took the Flag today  Can tell the definition  So clear of Victory<p> As he defeated — dying —  On whose forbidden ear  The distant strains of triumph  Burst agonized and clear!
"Faith" is a fine invention  When Gentlemen can ''see'' —  But ''Microscopes'' are prudent  In an Emergency.
"Hope" is the thing with feathers — <br />That perches in the soul — <br />And sings the tune without the words — <br />And never stops — at all — <p> And sweetest — in the Gale — is heard — <br />And sore must be the storm — <br />That could abash the little Bird<br />That kept so many warm —
I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br /> Are you — Nobody — Too?<br />
How dreary — to be — Somebody!<br /> How public — like a Frog — <br /> To tell one's name — the livelong June — <br /> To an admiring Bog!<br />
The Soul selects her own Society —  Then — shuts the Door —  To her divine Majority —  Present no more —
Some keep the Sabbath going to Church — I keep it, staying at Home— With a Bobolink for a Chorister — And an Orchard, for a Dome—
God preaches, a noted Clergyman — And the sermon is never long, So instead of getting to Heaven, at last— I’m going, all along.
This is my letter to the World  That never wrote to Me —  The simple News that Nature told —  With tender Majesty<p>Her Message is committed  To Hands I cannot see —  For love of Her — Sweet — countrymen —  Judge tenderly — of Me
I died for Beauty — but was scarce  Adjusted in the Tomb,  When One who died for Truth, was lain  In an adjoining Room —<p> He questioned softly "Why I failed"?  "For Beauty," I replied.  "And I — for Truth, — Themself are One — We Brethren, are", He said — 
Dreams — are well — but Waking's better,<br /> If One wake at Morn — <br /> If One wake at Midnight — better — <br /> Dreaming — of the Dawn — <br />
Love — thou art Veiled — <br /> A few — behold thee — <br /> Smile — and alter — and prattle — and die — <br /> Bliss — were an Oddity — without thee — <br /> Nicknamed by God — <br /> Eternity — <br />
I heard a Fly buzz — when I died — The Stillness in the Room Was like the Stillness in the Air — Between the Heaves of Storm —
Because I could not stop for Death — He kindly stopped for me — The Carriage held but just Ourselves — And Immortality.<p> We slowly drove — He knew no haste And I had put away My labor and my leisure too, For His Civility — 
Since then — 'tis Centuries — and yet Feels shorter than the Day I first surmised the Horses' Heads Were toward Eternity —<br />
My Life had stood — a Loaded Gun — In Corners — till a Day The Owner passed — identified — And carried Me away —<p>And now We roam in Sovereign Woods — And now We hunt the Doe — And every time I speak for Him — The Mountains straight reply —
We outgrow love, like other things And put it in the Drawer — Till it an Antique fashion shows — Like Costumes Grandsires wore.
A Grave — is a restricted Breadth — Yet ampler than the Sun — And all the Seas He populates And lands he looks upon<p>To Him who on its small Repose Bestows a single Friend — Circumference without Relief — Or Estimate — or End
To Whom the Mornings stand for Nights, What must the Midnights — be!
A Vastness, as a Neighbor, came, A Wisdom, without Face, or Name, A Peace, as Hemispheres at Home And so the Night became.
Tell all the Truth but tell it slant — <br /> Success in Circuit lies<br /> Too bright for our infirm Delight<br /> The Truth's superb surprise<p>As Lightning to the Children eased<br /> With explanation kind<br /> The Truth must dazzle gradually<br /> Or every man be blind —
Could Hope inspect her Basis Her Craft were done — Has a fictitious Charter Or it has none —<p>Balked in the vastest instance But to renew — Felled but by one assassin — Prosperity —
Not with a Club, the Heart is broken  Nor with a Stone —  A Whip so small you could not see it  I've known <p> To lash the Magic Creature  Till it fell,  Yet that Whip's Name  Too noble then to tell. <p> Magnanimous as Bird  By Boy descried —  Singing unto the Stone  Of which it died — <p> Shame need not crouch  In such an Earth as Ours —  Shame — stand erect —  The Universe is yours.
More than the Grave is closed to me — The Grave and that Eternity To which the Grave adheres — I cling to nowhere till I fall — The Crash of nothing, yet of all — How similar appears —
If Aims impel these Astral Ones The ones allowed to know Know that which makes them as forgot As Dawn forgets them — now
Who has not found the Heaven — below — Will fail of it above —
I took one Draught of Life — I'll tell you what I paid — Precisely an existence — The market price, they said.
How wrong Emily Dickinson was! Hope is not "the thing with feathers". The thing with feathers has turned out to be my nephew. I must take him to a specialist in Zurich.
Her poetry is the diary or autobiography — though few diaries or autobiographies compare with it for intentional and, especially, unintentional truth — of an acute psychologist, a wonderful rhetorician, and one of the most individual writers who ever lived, one of those best able to express experience at its most nearly absolute.
Even the best critical writing on Emily Dickinson underestimates her. She is frightening. To come to her directly from Dante, Spenser, Blake, and Baudelaire is to find her sadomasochism obvious and flagrant. Birds, bees, and amputated hands are the dizzy stuff of this poetry. Dickinson is like the homosexual cultist draping himself in black leather and chains to bring the idea of masculinity into aggressive visibility.
Emily Dickinson is the female Sade, and her poems are the prison dreams of a self-incarcerated, sadmomasochistic imaginist. When she is rescued from American Studies departments and juxtaposed with Dante and Baudelaire, her barbarities and diabolical acts of will become glaringly apparent. Dickinson inherits through Blake the rape cycle of The Faerie Queene. Blake and Spenser are her allies in helping pagan Coleridge defeat Protestant Wordsworth.
Richard Chase declares, "No great poet has written so much bad verse as Emily Dickinson." He blames the Victorian cult of little women for the fact that "two thirds of her work" is seriously flawed: "Her coy and oddly childish poems of nature and female friendship are products of a time when one of the careers open to women was perpetual childhood." Dickinson's sentimental feminine poems remain neglected by embarrassed scholars. I would maintain, however, that her poetry is a closed system of sexual reference and that the mawkish poems are designed to dovetail with those of violence and suffering.
