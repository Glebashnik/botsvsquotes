If there's a God, I want to see Him. It's pointless to believe in something without proof, and Krishna consciousness and meditation are methods where you can actually obtain God perception. In that way you can see, hear and play with God. Perhaps this may sound weird, but God is really there next to you.
From the Hindu perspective, each soul is divine. All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call. Just as cinematic images appear to be real but are only combinations of light and shade, so is the universal variety a delusion. The planetary spheres, with their countless forms of life, are naught but figures in a cosmic motion picture. One's values are profoundly changed when he is finally convinced that creation is only a vast motion picture and that not in, but beyond, lies his own ultimate reality.
My Hallelujah," and by the time it gets to "Hare Krishna," they're already hooked, and their foot's tapping, and they're already singing along "Hallelujah," to kind of lull them into a sense of false security. And then suddenly it turns into "Hare Krishna," and they will all be singing that before they know what's happened, and they will think, "Hey, I thought I wasn't supposed to like Hare Krishna!"
It just annoyed me that people got so into the Beatles. "Beatles, Beatles, Beatles." It's not that I don't like talking about them. I've never stopped talking about them. It's "Beatles this, Beatles that, Beatles, Beatles, Beatles, Beatles." Then in the end, it's like "Oh, sod off with the Beatles," you know?
I had no ambition when I was a kid other than to play guitar and get in a rock 'n' roll band. I don't really like to be the guy in the white suit at the front. Like in the Beatles, I was the one who kept quiet at the back and let the other egos be at the front.
He was annoyed 'cause I didn't say that he'd written one line of this song "Taxman." But I also didn't say how I wrote two lines of "Come Together" or three lines of "Eleanor Rigby," you know? I wasn't getting into any of that. I think, in the balance, I would have had more things to be niggled with him about than he would have had with me!
Rap music is just computerised crap. I listen to ''Top of the Pops'' and after three songs I feel like killing someone.
I felt in love, not with anything or anybody in particular but with everything.
*If everybody who had a gun just shot themselves there wouldn’t be a problem.
*You can be standing right in front of the truth and not necessarily see it, and people only get it when they’re ready to get it.
That's what the whole Sixties Flower-Power thing was about: "Go away, you bunch of boring people."
*I'd thought it would be something like King's Road London, only more. Somehow I expected them all to own their own little shops. I expected them to all be nice and clean and friendly and happy … (on the contrary, I discovered them to be) hideous, spotty little teenagers.
I don't mind anybody dropping out of anything, but it's the imposition on somebody else I don't like. The moment you start dropping out and then begging off somebody else to help you, then it's no good. It doesn't matter what you are as long as you work. It doesn't matter if you chop wood as long as you chop and keep chopping. Then you get what's coming to you. You don't have to drop out. In fact, if you drop out you put yourself further away from the goal of life than if you were to keep working.
If you're listening to this song  You may think the chords are going wrong  But they're not  We just wrote it like that
*...the more I learn the less I know...
*...we're dead...
Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to. Think for yourself 'Cause I won't be there with you.
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping  While my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love  I don't know how someone controlled you  They bought and sold you.
I look at the world and I notice it’s turning. While my guitar gently weeps.  With every mistake we must surely be learning, Still my guitar gently weeps.
I don't know how you were diverted  You were perverted too.  I don't know how you were inverted  No one alerted you.
Little darling, It's been a long cold lonely winter. Little darling, It feels like years since it's been here. Here comes the sun...
Little darling I feel that ice is slowly melting Little darling It seems like years since it's been clear  Here comes the sun...
Something in the way she moves <br /> attracts me like no other lover.
If I grow up I'll be a singer, wearing rings on every finger  Not worrying what they or you say, <br /> I'll live and love and maybe someday  Who knows baby  you may comfort me.
I really want to see you, <br /> Really want to be with you, <br /> Really want to see you lord, <br /> But it takes so long, my lord.
Give me love, give me peace on earth, <br /> Give me light, give me life, keep me free from birth, <br />Give me hope, help me cope, with this heavy load, <br />Trying to, touch and reach you with, heart and soul.
