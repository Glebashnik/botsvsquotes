*I don't even think about a retirement program because I'm working for the Lord, for the Almighty. And even thought the Lord's pay isn't very high, his retirement program is, you might say, out of this world.
*I want to keep fighting because it is the only thing that keeps me out of the hamburger joints. If I don't fight, I'll eat this planet.
*It was like fighting a billy-goat, butt and run. I was saved by the jab. No jab and we would have lost it.
*I've seen George Foreman shadow boxing and the shadow won!
