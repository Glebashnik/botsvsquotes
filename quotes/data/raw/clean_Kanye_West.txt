*"I am Warhol. I am the No. 1 most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney. Nike. Google.
*I ain’t no muthafuckin celebrity. I ain’t runnin’ for office. I ain’t kissin’ nobody’s muthafuckin babies. I drop your baby and you muthafuckin sue me and shit.
*The music and the clothing are just as important. That's what makes you hiphop. You show people that you're hiphop by what you wear.*
*You ain't got the answers Sway!
*I hate when I'm on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle
I still think I am the greatest.
Ya'll might as well get the music ready 'cause this is gonna take a while. When I had my accident, I found out at that moment, nothing in life is promised except death. If you have the opportunity to play this game called life, you have to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed. And then you got to tell those Al Bundy stories: 'You remember when I...' Right now, it's my time and my moment, thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to God, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest, everyone that's helped me. And I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get, 'cause I'm at the Grammy's baby! I know everybody asked me the question, they wanted to know, 'What, Kan, I know he's gonna wile out, I know he's gonna do something crazy.' Everybody wanted to know what I would do, if I didn't win... I guess we'll never know!
Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!
*Know your worth! People always act like they're doing more for you than you're doing for them. Ask yourself this question, "Why would they do that?" Obviously, you bring something to the table for them to even do business with you
*Would you believe in what you believe in if you were the only one who believed it?
*I refuse to accept other people's ideas of happiness for me. As if there's a "one size fits all" standard for happiness
I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, 'They're looting.' You see a white family, it says, 'They're looking for food.' And, you know, it's been five days waiting for federal help because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the TV because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was down there, and those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help -- with the way America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way -- and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us! ... George Bush doesn't care about black people.
I’m just giving of my body on the stage and putting my life at risk, literally. ... And I think about it. I think about my family and I’m like, wow, this is like being a police officer or something, in war or something.

*"Brains, power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russel / Your boy back on his hustle, you know what Ive been up to / killing y'all niggas on tha lyrical shit / Mayonnaise-Color Benz, I push Miracle Whips"

"I get down for my Grandfather who took my momma/Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat/At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit-ins/And with that in my blood I was born to be different/Now niggas can't make it to the ballots to choose leadership/But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership/That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it/Racism still alive they just be concealin' it/But I know they don't want me in the damn club/They even make me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club/I done did dirt and went to Church to get my hands scrubbed/Swear I been baptized at least three or four times/But in a land where niggas praise Yukon's and gettin' paid/It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved/Like it take a lot more than du-rags to get you waves/Nothing as sad as that day my girl's father passed away/So I promise to Mr. Rainey I'm going to marry your daughter/And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up"

"Told 'em I finished school, and I started my own business/They say, 'Oh you graduated?'/No, I decided I was finished/ Chasin' y'all dreams and what you've got planned/Now I spit it so hot you got tanned"
"Roc-A-Fella chain, yeah that's my rapper style/Rosary piece, yeah that's my Catholic style/Red and white One's, yeah that's my Kappa style/And I ain't even pledge/Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead/If I could go through all that and still be breathing/Bitch bend over, I'm here for a reason"
*"That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet/ Like a photo of your granny's picture/ Now that you're gone it hit us/ Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right"
*"I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind/ A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns"

*"With Kanye, the arrogant thing always comes up, but think about what that does for your ability to make art. He doesn't even question himself as to whether he can do it or not. He does it fast and good, and he doesn't stop on the side of the road to wonder if he can do it." - John Mayer (http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1500966/20050428/story.jhtml# From MTV.com)
*"The one thing I fear for Kanye the most is if you keep talking about being the greatest, people eventually are going to want to watch you fail." - John Mayer (http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1500966/20050428/story.jhtml From MTV.com)
*"It’s alright to say ‘bitch’ and ‘motherfucker' on the corner, but when you start operating on a different level you can’t talk like that. Fine, you’re trying to get some street acceptance. Now that you got that, get back to your roots. You know that’s not where you came from. You know that’s not how you were raised." - Ray West (Kanye's father) on Rolling Stone magazine
*"He's a jackass" - Barack Obama commenting privately on West after West interrupting Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards (http://web.archive.org/web/20090922232941/news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090915/ap_on_en_tv/us_tv_obama_tweet From the Associated Press)
