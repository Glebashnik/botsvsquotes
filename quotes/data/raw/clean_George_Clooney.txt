The hardest thing is trying not to correct everything on the Internet. It'd be night and day—wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. So you just have to say, "All right, I'll take it, bring it on."
We’re very generous people, Americans. We gave a billion a year with the Sudan to protect and help people after these tragedies. We’re going to be involved one way or another; we’re going to be there. It would be a lot better without spending a single dime, without costing any American lives — to get in there now with robust diplomacy, hard-core diplomacy, freezing assets, freezing bank accounts, doing everything we can to protect the people who want to vote for the right to freedom...If you knew a tsunami or Katrina or a Haiti earthquake was coming, what would you do to save people?
