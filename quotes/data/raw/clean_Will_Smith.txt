It's great to be black in Hollywood. When a black actor does something, it seems new and different just by virtue of the fact that he's black.
I feel like I could run for President. People often laugh, but if I set my mind to it, within the next 15 years I could be in the White House.
Even Hitler didn't wake up going, "let me do the most evil thing I can do today." I think he woke up in the morning and using a twisted, backwards logic, he set out to do what he thought was "good." Stuff like that just needs reprogramming. â€¦ I wake up every day full of hope, positive that every day is going to be better than yesterday. And I'm looking to infect people with my positivity. I think I can start an epidemic.
Too many people spend money they haven't earned, to buy things they don't want, to impress people they don't like.
