I've always been an actor. That's my job — I can be anything you want me to be.
For so long, I didn't play the object of attention or affection. It wasn't until ''L.A. Story'' that anyone cast me in a role that had my sexuality as a point of interest or focus or operation. I just wasn't examined in the same way that a 'pretty girl' would be.
I didn't think I was going to be a person who other people knew, whose name was recognizable.
Anything having to do with food is pleasurable for me. Any conversation about food, review of food, story of food, picture of food, thought of food...
Just because people don't have money doesn't mean they don't desire the same thing. They should have it, and it should be good.
I strangely feel better before I go through hair and makeup. Maybe that's just because I feel like me.
It never grows old, putting on a beautiful dress. For me, it's a great distraction. It's always ridiculous, and it always feels like it should be happening to somebody else.
My instinct was that it felt personal. It was really about 'We don't like her.' Who were the judges and critics? I would like to ask them, 'What exactly is it that you personally find not sexy about me? Is it my figure? Is it my brain that bothers you?'
That's the beauty of this country — we can have different opinions and coexist and be amused by each other and hurt and offended.
