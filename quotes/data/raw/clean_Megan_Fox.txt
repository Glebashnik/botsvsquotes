I'm the biggest nerd - I love comic books and stuff like that!
I'm not going to win an Oscar anytime soon. I'm not Meryl Streep.
Wonder Woman is a lame superhero. She flies around in her invisible jet and her weaponry is a lasso that makes you tell the truth. I just don't get it.
I don't understand why people don't have a f***ing sense of humor. Always assume that I'm being sarcastic.
I have the libido of a 15-year-old boy â€“ my sex drive is so high.
