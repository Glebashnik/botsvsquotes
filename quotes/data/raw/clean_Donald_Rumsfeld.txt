From Department of Defense news briefing, February 12, 2002 http://www.defenselink.mil/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636.
From a Press Conference at NATO Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium, June 6, 2002 http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3490http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2002/s020606g.htm
I can't tell you if the use of force in Iraq today would last five days, or five weeks, or five months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that.
And it is not knowable if force will be used, but if it is to be used, it is not knowable how long that conflict would last. It could last, you know, six days, six weeks. I doubt six months.
Then there are three or four countries that have said they won't do anything. I believe Libya, Cuba and Germany are ones that have indicated they won't help in any respect.
Now, you're thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I don't. I think that's old Europe.
It's a difficult thing today to be informed about our government even without all the secrecy.
From the http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2003/tr20030411-secdef0090.html DOD News Briefing following the fall of Baghdad, April 11, 2003:
I don't believe anyone that I know in the administration ever said that Iraq had nuclear weapons.
*You and a few other critics are the only people I've heard use the phrase immediate threat. I didn't, the president didn't. And it's become kind of folklore that that's what's happened.
But no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people and the stability of the world than the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.
I'm not into this detail stuff. I'm more concepty.
Look at me! I'm sweet and lovable!
Osama bin Laden is either alive and well or alive and not too well or not alive.
I stand for 8-10 hours a day. Why is standing limited to four hours?
We're so conditioned as a people to think that a military campaign has to be cruise missiles and television images of airplanes dropping bombs, and that's just false. This is a totally different war. We need a new vocabulary. We need to get rid of old think and start thinking about this thing the way it really is.
We know where they Iraq's WMD are. They're in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south, and north somewhat....I would also add, we saw from the air that there were dozens of trucks that went into that facility after the existence of it became public in the press and they moved things out. They dispersed them and took them away. So there may be nothing left. I don't know that. But it's way too soon to know. The exploitation is just starting.
I didn't advocate invasion…I wasn't asked.
…it seems to me that it's up to all of us to try to tell the truth, to say what we know, to say what we don't know, and recognize that we're dealing with people that are perfectly willing to, to lie to the world to attempt to further their case and to the extent people lie of, ultimately they are caught lying and they lose their credibility and one would think it wouldn't take very long for that to happen dealing with people like this.
As you know, you go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time. Since the Iraq conflict began, the Army has been pressing ahead to produce the armor necessary at a rate that they believe -- it's a greatly expanded rate from what existed previously, but a rate that they believe is the rate that is all that can be accomplished at this moment.
I shouldn't get into … this is diplomacy, and I don't do diplomacy.http://www.guardian.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,,1943315,00.htmlhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0304/30/se.01.htmlhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/bh/rumsfeld.shtml
We do have a saying in America: if you're in a hole, stop digging ..... erm, I'm not sure I should have said that.http://www.guardian.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,,1943315,00.htmlhttp://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/09/24/schroeder.blair/index.htmlhttp://web.archive.org/web/20030621143902/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s865620.htm
What we are seeing is not the war in Iraq. What we're seeing is slices of the war in Iraq.http://www.guardian.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,,1943315,00.htmlhttp://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0303/21/se.14.htmlhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june03/warcoverage_3-22.html
Well, so be it. Nothing's perfect in life, so you have an election that's not quite perfect. Is it better than not having an election? You bet.
It recalls to mind the statement by Winston Churchill, something to the effect that: I have benefited greatly from criticism, and at no time have I suffered a lack thereof. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/08/AR2006110801579.html?nav=rss_politics
It is pretty clear that the coalition can win in Afghanistan and Iraq in one way or another, but it will be a long, hard slog. http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/10/22/sprj.irq.main/index.html
Those who follow orders to commit such crimes will be found and they will be punished. War crimes will be prosecuted. And it will be no excuse to say, 'I was just following orders.' Any official involved in such crimes will forfeit hope of amnesty or leniency with respect to past action.
Oh, Lord. I didn't mean to say anything quotable.
Let's hear it for the essential daily briefing, however hollow and empty it might be. We'll do it.
Congress, the press, and the bureaucracy too often focus on how much money or effort is spent, rather than whether the money or effort actually achieves the announced goal.
It is easier to get into something than to get out of it.
Be able to resign. It will improve your value to the President and do wonders for your performance.
There will be good moments, and there will be less good moments.
I don't know what the facts are but somebody's certainly going to sit down with him and find out what he knows that they may not know, and make sure he knows what they know that he may not know, and that's a good thing.
Pieces of intelligence, scraps of intelligence…you run down leads and you run down leads, and you hope that sometimes it works.
And there is, I am certain, among the Iraqi people a respect for the care and the precision that went into the bombing campaign.
Stuff happens.
I suppose the implication of that is the president and the vice president and myself and Colin Powell just fell off a turnip truck to take these jobs.
After he saw what happened to Saddam Hussein, he (Gaddafi) did not want to be Saddam Hussein. He gave up his nuclear program.
The natural state of man is to want to be free. To have opportunities. To have choices.
We are paying a very heavy price for the mismanagement &mdash; that's the kindest word I can give you &mdash; of Donald Rumsfeld, of this war. The price is very, very heavy and I regret it enormously. I think that Donald Rumsfeld will go down in history as one of the worst secretaries of defense in history.
*Here's what I can tell you about Don Rumsfeld. You're never going to get any credit. And you'll only know how well you're doing if he gives you more work. If that happens, you're doing fine.
Rumsfeld told a group of senior Pentagon aides, “I never again want our army to arrive somewhere and meet the CIA on the ground.” To a gathering of top generals in “the tank,” the Joint Chiefs' secure conference room, he was even more succinct: “Every CIA success,” he told them, “is a DoD failure.”
