Courage is the price that  Life exacts for granting peace.  The soul that knows it not, knows no release  From little things:  Knows not the livid loneliness of fear,  Nor mountain heights where bitter joy can hear  The sound of wings.
How can Life grant us boon of living, compensate  For dull grey ugliness and pregnant hate Unless we dare The soul's dominion? Each time we make a choice, we pay With courage to behold the resistless day,  And count it fair.
Ours is the commencement of a flying age, and I am happy to have popped into existence at a period so interesting.
I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any midaevil<!-- SIC : misspelling of medieval --&gt; code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.
The time to worry is three months before a flight. Decide then whether or not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, stop worrying. To worry is to add another hazard. It retards reactions, makes one unfit. . . . Hamlet would have been a bad aviator. He worried too much.
The more one does and sees and feels, the more one is able to do, and the more genuine may be one's appreciation of fundamental things like home, and love, and understanding companionship.
Never interrupt someone doing something you said couldn't be done.
Anticipation, I suppose, sometimes exceeds realization.
Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture.
In my life I had come to realize that when things were going very well indeed it was just the time to anticipate trouble. And, conversely, I learned from pleasant experience that at the most despairing crisis, when all looked sour beyond words, some delightful "break" was apt to lurk just around the corner.
Please know that I am aware of the hazards. I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be a challenge to others.
Never do things others can do and will do, if there are things others cannot do or will not do.
Better do a good deed near at home than go far away to burn incense.
No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another. Good example is followed. A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees. The greatest work that kindness does to others is that it makes them kind themselves.
