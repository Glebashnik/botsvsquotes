*Magic is not about having a puzzle to solve. It's about creating a moment of awe and astonishment. And that can be a beautiful thing
*As a Magician, I try to show things to people that seem impossible. And I think magic whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards is pretty simple: It's practice, it's training and it's experimenting while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be. And that's what magic is to me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFnGhrC_3Gs
*My old man taught me to approach everything like it was the first time I'd tried it, that way I wouldn't know what was impossible. Dope quote, dad.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk6IOiG74zA
