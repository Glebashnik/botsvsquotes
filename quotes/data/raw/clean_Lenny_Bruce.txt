A Jew, in the dictionary, is one who is descended from the ancient tribes of Judea, or one who is regarded as a descendant from that tribe. That's what it says in the dictionary, but you and I know what a Jew is: One Who Killed Our Lord... there should be a statute of limitations for that crime.
I want to perform an unnatural act.
If something about the human body disgusts you, the fault lies with the manufacturer.
Are there any niggers here tonight? Could you turn on the house lights, please, and could the waiters and waitresses just stop serving, just for a second? And turn off this spot. Now what did he say? "Are there any niggers here tonight?" I know there's one nigger, because I see him back there working. Let's see, there's two niggers. And between those two niggers sits a kyke. And there's another kykeâ€” that's two kykes and three niggers. And there's a spic. Right? Hmm? There's another spic. Ooh, there's a wop; there's a polack; and, oh, a couple of greaseballs. And there's three lace-curtain Irish micks. And there's one, hip, thick, hunky, funky, boogie. Boogie boogie. Mm-hmm. I got three kykes here, do I hear five kykes? I got five kykes, do I hear six spics, I got six spics, do I hear seven niggers? I got seven niggers. Sold American. I pass with seven niggers, six spics, five micks, four kykes, three guineas, and one wop. Well, I was just trying to make a point, and that is that it's the suppression of the word that gives it the power, the violence, the viciousness. Dig: if President Kennedy would just go on television, and say, "I would like to introduce you to all the niggers in my cabinet," and if he'd just say "nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger" to every nigger he saw, "boogie boogie boogie boogie boogie," "nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger" 'til nigger didn't mean anything anymore, then you could never make some six-year-old black kid cry because somebody called him a nigger at school.
Take away the right to say "fuck" and you take away the right to say "fuck the government."
The role of a comedian is to make the audience laugh, at a minimum of once every fifteen seconds.
I'm not a comedian. I'm Lenny Bruce.
You can't put tits and ass on the marquee!...Why not?...Because it's dirty and vulgar, that's why not!... Titties are dirty and vulgar?...Okay, we'll compromise. How about Latin? ''Gluteus maximus,'' ''pectoralis majors'' nightly...That's alright, that's clean, class with ass, I'll buy it...Clean to you, schmuck, but dirty to the Latins!
Let me tell you the truth. The truth is what is, and what should be is a fantasy. A terrible, terrible lie that someone gave to the people long ago.
*Lenny Bruce's legacy is freedom of speech and telling it as it is, getting your life and putting it out on the table, telling everyone about it.
*And I learned the truth from Lenny Bruce,<br />That all my wealth won't buy me health<br />So I smoke a pint of tea a day.
*They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules<br /> He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
*Just don't forget your history, dirty Lenny died so we could all be free
*That's great, it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes, an aeroplane - Lenny Bruce is not afraid.
*Mother Goose is on the loose, stealing lines from Lenny Bruce.
*I want to be Lenny Bruce.
*Lenny Bruce, declares a truce and plays his other hand. Marshall McLuhan, casual viewin', head buried in the sand.
*For Halloween, I want to be Lenny Bruce, I want them to hate me, so you can love me on the sly.
*Ginsberg, Dylan, Cunningham and Cage  Lenny Bruce, Langston Hughes, to the stage
*Lenny Bruce was trying to tell you many things before he died...
