Don't worry, Chief, Inspector Gadget is always on duty.
Am I right? Inspector Gadget is always right.
This car is acting funny. Ah, of course, the emergency brake is on.
Go Go Gadget mini suit! Go Go Gadget mini shoes and mini hat!
Wowsers! It's the top secret Gadget phone. (''Talks into hand'') Is that you, Chief? You're where? Right away.
An air show? Now why would anybody want to pay to see air?
All work and no play makes Gadget a dull boy.

Now I'll prove to you that Martians are just an image of your figment. Uh, I mean a figure of your sensation. Well you know what I mean.
Be careful, Brain, those are probably priceless fake artifacts.
I haven't seen this much snow since that episode in the Arctic.
I'd better get a new rubber duckie. This one is too mean.
This place is as empty as a graveyard on Halloween.
No one gets away from Inspector Gadget and gets away with it.
When I'm following someone, I hate being followed!
Excellent, Capman. That's what I call a strike.
*Yikes!!!
You never know what might happen with Uncle Gadget.
Gosh.
Wowsers!
I better call Brain.
So that's it.
You better follow Uncle Gadget.
Go Go Gadget Breakfast!
I'm worried, Brain. You'd better follow Uncle Gadget.
Brain, look! Uncle Gadget'll be crushed! ''shouts'' Uncle Gadget, behind you! A landslide!
Rowsers!

Reah!
Reah. Re read rone of rose.
I'll get you next time, Gadget... next time! ''M.A.D. Cat meows''
Eh, M.A.D. Cat?
This nasty Transylvanian atmosphere is good for my health.
You may have stopped my M.A.D. robots, but you will not escape my flashing ball.
Gadget!? All the Gadgets are still alive!!!
Four legged is four armed, Gadget!
Fly, Capeman, fly!
Fly, Capeman, fly! Whoopee!
Go Go Corporal Capeman!
Oh, great Inspector Gadget! It's an honor to meet you.
I'm flying! Wee!

Dr. Claw: Well, Mr. Spectrum. Dr. Spectrum: ''Doctor'' Spectrum. Dr. Claw: DON'T TALK BACK!
Chief Quimby: Congratulations, Gadget, I don't know how you did it. Gadget: Thanks, Chief. Uh, what did I do?

Gadget: Penny, finish the breakfast and off to school. I don't want you to be late. Penny: But it's Saturday.
Penny: I think that nice little magician is a M.A.D. agent. Maybe we shouldn't go, Uncle Gadget? Gadget: Nonsense, Penny. It will be a great fun.
Penny: Do you really think Dr. Claw is behind this?  Gadget: Of course not, Penny.
Gadget: I must head to Everest Island for the secret mission.  Penny: Can we come along?  Gadget: It may be dangerous.  Penny: Brain and I just play on the beach.  Gadget: And I complete my mission. Well, okay. We all go.  Penny: Hooray!
Penny: Gosh. Scotland is beatiful, Uncle Gadget.  Gadget: It certainly is, Penny. This is where they make Scotch tape, ya know.
