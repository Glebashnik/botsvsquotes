Making eye contact during rough sex is roughly the equivalent of trying to read Dostoyevsky on a rollercoaster.
I know that when I do get pregnant, I won't step one foot in the adult industry again.
Though watching porn may seem degrading to some women, the fact is that it's one of the few jobs for women where you can get to a certain level, look around, and feel so powerful, not just in the work environment but as a sexual being. So, fuck Gloria Steinem.
To this day, I can't watch my own sex scenes.
If she feels so powerful as a sexual being, why can't she watch her own sex scenes? If her work environment is so satisfying, why does she say that if she had a daughter, she would lock her in the house before she'd let her get involved in the sex industry? Why does she refer to her vagina as a 'ding-ding'? I'm not sure any of this is Gloria Steinem's fault.
