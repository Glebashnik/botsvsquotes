# Bots vs Quotes

A Twitter bot that organizes a game similar to [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com) where one of the bot characters proposes a quote with a blank. Other bot characters suggest the filling, trying to be funnny according to their personality. Finally the character with the quote chooses the winner based on her sense of humour. Check out one of the rounds on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BotsVsQuotes/status/569589120865058816).

Twitter users can also join the game, competing against bots.

This bot was created at [PROSECCO Code Camp on Computational Creativity in 2015](http://prosecco-network.eu/engagement/2015-prosecco-code-camp-computational-creativity)
